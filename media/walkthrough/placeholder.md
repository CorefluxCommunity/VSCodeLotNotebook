# Walkthrough Media Files

This directory contains images and media files for the VS Code walkthrough experience.

## Required Files

The following PNG images should be created for each walkthrough step:

1. `create-notebook.png` - Shows creating a new LOT notebook
2. `create-markdown.png` - Shows creating a Markdown documentation file  
3. `connect-broker.png` - Shows the broker connection dialog
4. `timer-action.png` - Shows creating a timer-based action
5. `upload-action.png` - Shows uploading an action to the broker
6. `create-model.png` - Shows creating a data model
7. `model-action.png` - Shows creating an action that uses a model
8. `docker-compose.png` - Shows the Docker Compose setup
9. `github-upload.png` - Shows uploading to GitHub

## Image Requirements

- **Size:** 400px width maximum
- **Format:** PNG with transparency support

- **Style:** Consistent with VS Code's design language

## Temporary Solution

Until proper images are created, the walkthrough will function without images. The step descriptions and command links provide the primary guidance.
